/**
 * The embedding-provider registry — a plain object, NOT any discovery
 * mechanism (implicit cross-package discovery is exactly what this repo's
 * composition-as-code design forbids). A composition root extends the object
 * or passes a provider instance directly; an unknown name fails LOUD at boot.
 * Converted from the oracle's sor_content/lib/providers/__init__.py.
 *
 * `gemini` is the shipped transport; `fake` is a ksor addition (key-free,
 * deterministic — CI's provider; see fake.ts). `buildShippedProvider` is THE
 * ONE door every composition root builds through: registry name + key + the
 * DECLARED space, with the task labels and the framework's timeout knobs
 * bound internally so no caller spells a label or a knob. (The oracle's raw
 * `build_embedding_provider` door — every identity field explicit — served
 * tests and deliberate non-config identities; TS tests construct adapters
 * directly, so it is not ported.)

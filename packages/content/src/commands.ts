const USAGE = `ksor — the KSoR content kernel's write plane

Usage:
  ksor schema (--dim N | --instance PATH) [--apply]
      Print the rendered DDL for the embedding dimension to stdout.
      --instance reads the dimension from instance.md; --apply (with
      --instance) provisions the instance's database, or migrates an
      existing one forward through schema/migrations/.
  ksor ingest --instance PATH [--flip] [--source-commit SHA]
      Build one generation from the record beside instance.md: run the record
      checker, require a fresh build.lock.json, apply the takedown ledger, then
      structure atomically, embed resumably, finalize behind the ready gate.
      --flip activates it (never implicit). The source commit is read from git
      when the tree is in a repository; --source-commit overrides it.
  ksor calibrate --instance PATH [--queries-file PATH] [--ooc-file PATH]
                 [--generation N] [--per-node N] [--min-chars N]
  ksor calibrate --instance PATH --check [--days N]
      Measure the abstention floor for this corpus and report it. A
      measurement that does not separate in-corpus from out-of-corpus prints
      the diagnosis and NO floor: there is no safe number to paste.
      --check reads the record's OWN logged searches instead and reports how
      the declared floor is holding against them — no provider key, no
      embedding call, no LLM. A monitor, never a gate: it says what to
      re-measure, and a verdict always exits 0 — the environment exits 3, as
      for every verb.
  ksor grant --instance PATH [--revoke]
      Authorize ingest for the instance's tenant (the row row-level security
      requires), or withdraw it. Idempotent; reports the state it established.
  ksor takedown --actor ACTOR [--instance PATH] [--scope node|subtree]
                --reason TEXT [--file-only] <stable-id>
                --actor ACTOR (--revoke ENTRY-ID | --removed ENTRY-ID) [--reason TEXT]
                --apply | --list | --ledger        (read or replay; no --actor)
      Withdraw a document from EVERY surface, ledger first: the act is appended
      to .ksor/takedowns.yaml — committed, append-only, read by the site — and
      then, when the record declares a database and its DSN is present, written
      as the denylist row the door reads. A record with no database gets
      takedown through the ledger alone. --scope subtree denies a directory and
      every descendant; --file-only records the entry without the row;
      --revoke lifts a denial by naming its entry id (never by deleting a line)
      and --removed records that a denied document was deleted; --apply writes
      every unapplied entry's row under its own recorded actor. --list shows
      what is denied, --ledger the recorded governance acts.
      --actor names WHO is performing the act and is REQUIRED to write the
      ledger: the entry is the evidence that a person withdrew this document, a
      name guessed from the shell attributes nothing, and the policy's
      takedown_authorities must name it.
  ksor gc --instance PATH [--dry-run]
      Reap generations the §5 algebra allows (never active/rollback, 40-min
      token grace, ≥2 complete generations remain).
  ksor rollback --instance PATH
      Restore the generation that was active BEFORE the last flip — the undo
      when a post-flip acceptance check fails. Goes backward by design; refuses
      when no prior generation is recorded, and refuses a SECOND consecutive
      rollback (the active generation is already the rollback target — nothing
      to restore). Prints the restored generation and
      its embedding model, which the runtime image's provider/model must match
      (a mismatch must fail closed, never query an incompatible vector space).
      Preserves the audit trail; the superseded generation remains until gc.

--instance PATH is an instance.md, or a directory at or below the record
root: --instance . works from anywhere inside it.

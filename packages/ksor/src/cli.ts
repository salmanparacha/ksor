 * Serve is one of the four commands the README tells an adopter to run, it is
 * configured almost entirely by environment variable rather than by flag, and
 * it is the verb whose likeliest first failure — a port already held — sends a
 * reader hunting for the variable that moves it. It had no page at all: `ksor
 * serve --help` fell through to the verb list, and so did `ksor init --help`,
 * while every other verb answered for itself (first-hour walkthrough,
 * 2026-08-26).
 *
 * The variables here are the ones a FIRST run needs. env.example carries the
 * full contract with the prose around each name, and this says so rather than
 * reprinting it — one fact, one file.

const serveUsage = `Usage: ksor serve [--instance <path>]

Serves the record's MCP surface over stateless Streamable HTTP at POST /mcp —
the agent half of the same corpus the site publishes. It SERVES what \`ksor
ingest\` published; it never publishes, so a record that has not been ingested
serves nothing. Runs in this process and holds it; SIGTERM/SIGINT drains.

  --instance <path>   instance.md, or a directory at or below the record root
                      (default: ./instance.md, or $KSOR_INSTANCE)

Configured by environment — .env beside the record is read automatically:

  <database.dsn_env>       the Postgres DSN, under the NAME instance.md gives
  <provider key>           iff the instance's embedding provider needs one:
                           GEMINI_API_KEY for gemini, OPENAI_API_KEY for openai.
                           The refusal names the variable your record needs
  KSOR_AUTH                disabled-local (loopback dev) | disabled-public.
                           Serve REFUSES to boot with neither this nor a
                           configured SSO door — never open by accident
  KSOR_MCP_HOST            bind address (default 127.0.0.1; $PORT means 0.0.0.0)
  KSOR_MCP_PORT            bind port (default 8080) — the answer to
                           "address already in use"
  KSOR_SSO_URL, KSOR_MCP_RESOURCE_URL, KSOR_JWT_ALLOWED_AUDIENCES
                           the public door: sign every call with a real
                           authorization server
  KSOR_SNAPSHOT_KEYS       kid=secret[,...]; REQUIRED on any multi-replica or
                           scale-to-zero host, or generation pins stop verifying
  KSOR_AUDIENCE            who this door answers as (default: public)
  KSOR_MIN_TRUST_TIER      the lowest trust tier it will answer from

Every variable, with what each one costs: the scaffold's env.example.
Exit codes: 1 refused · 3 environment (a held port, an unreachable store)

 * The MCP door: the SDK v2 HTTP entry (Request → Response, stateless)
 * behind Hono, serving the 2026-07-28 revision with 2025-era clients still
 * answered through the stateless fallback. Modern exchanges are buffered JSON;
 * the legacy leg answers over SSE (the SDK's own shape) and is DRAINED here
 * before the concurrency slot is released.
 *
 * The MCP surface is the product, so the door composes the SDK's own HTTP
 * shape instead of hand-rolling routing and body parsing — the layer three
 * findings landed in.
 *
 * Contracts the hand-rolled door had earned and this one keeps (a framework
 * doesn't know them, so they are restored explicitly — review, 2026-08-19):
 * fail-soft env parsing (envInt, never `Number(env ?? default)`); the bind
 * is AWAITED so EADDRINUSE/EACCES reach the CLI exit contract, not a stack
 * trace; the boot line prints AFTER binding; SIGTERM drains the pool only
 * AFTER the listener closes; the exact HSTS contract (max-age 63072000).
 *
 * What stays ours because it is good: buildAuth and the fail-closed boot
 * posture, the three probes, the concurrency cap, the content kernel.

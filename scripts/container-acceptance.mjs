/**
 * The emitted container, proven WITHOUT a hosting vendor.
 *
 * `ksor init` now ships a Dockerfile, and the claim attached to it is that the
 * served rung runs anywhere — "vendor-free is the ownership argument". A claim
 * only checked by deploying to one vendor is a claim about that vendor. So this
 * walks the artifact on plain Docker: scaffold, publish a generation, build the
 * image, boot it, and ask it a question over MCP.
 *
 * It installs the LOCAL build rather than the published one (the tier rule paid
 * for with shipped defects: the test must install the same tree the artifact
 * installs). The Dockerfile is used as emitted, with ONE line inserted to bring
 * the local tarball into the build context — and the insertion is asserted to be
 * the only difference, so this can never quietly drift into testing a different
 * recipe than adopters get.
 *
 * NO VENDOR KEY: the walk pins the deterministic, key-free `fake` embedding
 * provider (the scaffold defaults to Gemini). "No vendor" is the job's name and
 * its point — it proves the container/MCP path with no vendor API key at all,
 * which is what lets it run on a fork that holds no secrets. Real embedding
 * fidelity is covered by the database and live-provider tiers.
